PillEase is an innovative Android application developed as part of a university project, designed to revolutionize the way individuals manage their medication schedules. At the heart of PillEase is a smart pill dispenser, controlled via an ESP32 module, which interfaces seamlessly with the app to dispense medications accurately according to schedules set by users.

The application harnesses the power of Firebase for robust user authentication, ensuring secure access to the app's features. It utilizes Firestore, a NoSQL database, for real-time data storage and retrieval, enabling the app to fetch medication schedules and update them dynamically. This integration allows the ESP32-powered pill dispenser to adjust in real-time, ensuring medications are dispensed precisely when needed.

Key features of PillEase include:

Secure Authentication: Utilizes Firebase to manage user sign-in and registration, safeguarding user data and access.

Real-Time Scheduling: Leverages Firestore for storing and updating medication schedules, ensuring timely medication dispensing.

Hardware Integration: Employs an ESP32 module for smart pill dispenser operation, making medication management effortless and reliable.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with accessibility in mind, the app offers a seamless user experience for managing medication schedules, viewing upcoming doses, and receiving reminders.

This project not only showcases proficiency in Android development with Kotlin but also demonstrates an interdisciplinary approach to solving real-world healthcare challenges through technology. PillEase stands as a testament to the potential of combining mobile app development with IoT devices to enhance healthcare accessibility and adherence to medication regimens.
